PyRAA Acknowlegements
=====================

Our current knowledge of restricted multi-body dynamics is a result of nearly three centuries 
of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers committed to furthering humanity's understanding of 
intricate gravitational interactions. The purpose of the PyRAA project is to make modern tools of multi-body 
dynamics accessible to specialists and casual users as more use-cases for the techniques are discovered.

Many of the capabilities found in PyRAA are implementations of algorithms produced by the `Purdue University Multi-body Dynamics Research Group
<https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/Publications/publications.html>`_.
